This program asks the user when they want an alarm to go off, and plays an mp3 file at those times.

It's a simple solution, with little elegance, but I'm thinking about ways to improve it. I could give it an actual interface with tkinter, or have it search for and play a user-specified youtube video instead of needing to download an mp3 file and include it in the code.

NOTE: The sleep function in the else statement is meant to slow the while loop, but it does mean that the alarm won't go off right at the time specified. If you don't plan on running this program in the background, then you can remove the else statement.
