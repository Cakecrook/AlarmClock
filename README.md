The inspiration for this project came from my desire to wake up to a certain song, and finding out that there weren't any applications that would do this for me. I was surprised because I figured it wouldn't be very hard to code such an application.

At first I wanted to code something that would allow me to play a user-specified song on spotify. Unfortunately I struggled with spotipy, so I looked into easier solutions. I found that playsound was a much more cooperative library, and that it would work just fine. 

So I downloaded an mp3 file of the song I wanted to get up to and got coding. I'm not going to include the mp3 file or the name of the song in my repository.

It's a simple solution, with little elegance, but I'm thinking about ways to improve it. I could give it a user interface with tkinter, or have it search for and play a user-specified youtube video.
